# CrispCalc — Repair & Completion Plan

Living document. Each task: `[ ]` pending · `[~]` in-progress · `[x]` done.
Completed items are moved (with date) to `HISTORY.md`.

See `HISTORY.md` for the most recent work: 60 new unit tests covering plane,
conic, numerical helpers and full AppState persistence; the calculator
history clear button; persistent history / variables / graph functions;
and the light/dark/system theme picker.

## P1 — Open follow-ups

- [x] ~~Make `CrispCalc` repo public.~~ Done 2026-05-17 — see HISTORY.
- [ ] **Native `limit`.** The native bridge doesn't expose a `limit`
  entry point and SymEngine itself doesn't ship a general
  `limit(f, x, a)` — there's nothing to bind to yet. To unblock, work
  has to land in the bridge's C++ layer first, then a one-line Dart
  binding follows. Three tiers, increasing effort:
  1. **Series-based**: use SymEngine's `series_n` to compute a Taylor
     expansion at the point and return the constant term. Handles
     analytic functions with finite limits. Misses `sin(x)/x`, most
     transcendental ratios.
  2. **L'Hôpital loop**: handcrafted in C++ over SymEngine's `diff`
     and `subs`. Handles 0/0 and ∞/∞ for ratios; iterates until the
     limit is determinate or a step budget is hit. Covers the common
     calculus-textbook cases.
  3. **Gruntz algorithm**: full general limit-finding. Real CAS
     engineering — port from SymPy's reference implementation. Wide
     coverage but a multi-week project.
  Numerical one-sided / infinity limits (`lib/engine/numerical.dart`)
  stay as the safety net regardless of which tier ships. Native
  `integrate` was bound similarly — see HISTORY round 7.
- [x] ~~**`flutter build macos --release`: SymEngine wrapper symbols dropped.**~~
  Fixed 2026-05-17 — see HISTORY round 13. Bridge plugin now uses an
  `+load` keepalive with an asm-clobber `DoNotOptimize` loop over every
  `flutter_symengine_*` function pointer. Release builds keep all 45
  wrapper symbols.
- [ ] **iOS smoke test.** Not run since the recent changes.

## P2 — Engine + native bridge

- [ ] **High-precision evaluation.** `SymbolicMathBridge.evaluateWithPrecision`
  / `gmpPower` / `mpfrHighPrecisionPi` still throw — wire them when the
  C++ wrapper exposes the corresponding symbols.
- [x] ~~**Matrix arithmetic end-to-end.** Confirm `det(Matrix([[…]]))`,
  `inv(...)`, `transpose(...)` round-trip cleanly through the engine
  with a release SymEngine build.~~ Done 2026-05-17 — see HISTORY
  round 16. Required a new `MatrixEvaluator` that routes matrix
  expressions through the FFI matrix bindings (SymEngine's text
  parser doesn't recognize `Matrix(...)` literals). 6/6 self-test
  checks pass in the release build; trigger them with the
  `CRISPCALC_DIAGNOSTIC=matrix` env var or via Settings → "Matrix
  self-test".

## P2 — UX polish

- [x] ~~**More translations.** German is up to date; Spanish / French
  would be cheap follow-ups.~~ Done 2026-05-17 — see HISTORY round 17.
  Full FR and ES locales (~95 strings each) plus a per-locale
  non-emptiness test suite (20 checks) so missing strings would fail
  CI rather than a runtime UI lookup.
- [x] ~~**Variable substitution dialog** — no more typing `subst(...)`.~~
  Done 2026-05-17 — see HISTORY round 14.
- [x] ~~**Plot annotations** — mark extrema and roots on the graph
  when an analysis is open.~~ Done 2026-05-17 — see HISTORY round 15.
  Toggleable from the graphing screen toolbar; uses numerical scan
  with bisection / parabolic refinement so no SymEngine round-trip
  per point.

## P3 — Long tail

- [x] ~~Symbolic Gauss / RREF on matrices.~~ Done 2026-05-17 — see
  HISTORY round 19. `rref(...)` is wired into the matrix evaluator,
  the keypad, and the self-test battery; the canonical 2×3 textbook
  example reduces correctly in release.
- [x] ~~CI: GitHub Actions to run `flutter analyze` + `flutter test` on PR.~~
  In place since round 8 (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Round 18 also
  switched the macOS build workflow to `--release` and added a
  headless matrix-diagnostic step, so the bridge plugin's release
  symbol-keep regression risk is caught in CI now.
- [x] ~~History view filtering / search.~~ Done 2026-05-17 — see
  HISTORY round 14.

## P4 — Production-readiness (gaps for a real release)

Things that matter once real users install the app, separate from any
single feature. Roughly in priority order — top items unblock the next.

### Operability

- [ ] **Crash reporting (opt-in)**. Today a release crash on a user's
  device is invisible to us. Add a privacy-respecting crash reporter
  (Sentry self-hosted, or just a "send a crash log" button that emails
  the report rather than uploading silently). Opt-in only — keeps the
  "no telemetry" promise from the About screen honest.
- [ ] **Storage hardening**. History persists via `shared_preferences`
  which has no size guarantees and is the wrong tool for a growing log.
  At minimum: LRU cap on history entries. Better: move to `sembast` or
  `sqflite`. Also: export-to-file (JSON / LaTeX / PDF) so the user can
  back up before reinstall.
- [ ] **Distribution pipeline**. macOS and iOS builds are unsigned, so
  the App Store / TestFlight / hardened-runtime paths aren't open. Apple
  Developer enrollment + notarization workflow + automatic version
  bumping on tag. Same shape for Android via Play.
- [ ] **Long-evaluation off-main-thread**. Big integrals or matrix ops
  can freeze the UI for several seconds. Wrap bridge calls in a Dart
  isolate (or at least `compute()`) and show the progress overlay
  (`lib/widgets/progress_overlay.dart` already exists, just isn't wired
  in for engine calls).

### Quality

- [ ] **UI flow tests**. Widget tests today cover "app boots." Every
  calculator gesture — enter expression, tap solve, store as variable,
  open substitute dialog, run analysis — has zero test coverage. A
  button rename can break a flow without CI flagging it. Add coverage
  for the 10 most-used flows.
- [ ] **Integration tests via `integration_test` package**. The
  matrix-diagnostic env-var hack is a stand-in for what should be a
  real integration suite that drives the actual UI in CI. Once the
  package is in place, port the matrix battery and add flows that the
  widget tests can't easily exercise.
- [ ] **Golden tests for plot painter + LaTeX rendering**. Subtle
  regressions in those two surfaces are invisible until a user
  complains. Pixel-comparison goldens in CI catch them deterministically.
- [ ] **Accessibility audit**. Add `Semantics` widgets to keypad
  buttons, label every IconButton, verify keyboard navigation for the
  full settings flow, audit color contrast in both themes, test with
  VoiceOver / TalkBack. Currently the keypad is a wall of unlabeled
  buttons to a screen reader.

### User experience

- [ ] **Real error messages**. A student typing `det(x)` gets
  "Error: evaluate failed: SymbolicMathException: evaluate - parse
  failed". Replace with plain-language explanations + the offending
  fragment underlined + a fix suggestion. Map the common error classes
  (parse error, dimension mismatch, missing variable, etc.) to
  curated messages.
- [ ] **Onboarding tour**. First launch shows a 4-card tour: keypad
  tabs, history scroll, function picker, analysis hub. Skippable.
  Discoverable features stop being a problem.
- [ ] **User documentation**. The README is a developer README. Add a
  user-facing docs site (or in-app help screen) listing every supported
  function with one-line examples, the LaTeX↔engine mapping table, and
  the matrix syntax cheatsheet. The function index alone is a
  high-traffic page elsewhere.
- [ ] **Share / export**. Copy a result as LaTeX. Share a calculation
  via the platform share sheet. Export the history (or a selection) as
  PDF for homework hand-in.

### Polish

- [ ] **Localize the picker dialogs**. `IntegralDialog`,
  `LimitDialog`, `NthRootDialog`, `SubstituteDialog` are still
  hardcoded English. The DE/FR/ES infrastructure is in place; this is
  mechanical — move strings to `AppLocalizations` and remove the
  `const Text('Limit')` literals.
- [ ] **Perf instrumentation**. Frame-timing overlay in debug, jank
  detection in CI for one canonical flow, repeatable benchmark for the
  graph painter at common viewport sizes. Currently we don't know if
  CrispCalc feels sluggish on a low-end Android device.

## P5 — Feature surface: gaps to close

Things we don't do today that have become standard in the calculator-
app category. Some are pedagogy features, some are graphing features,
some are knowledge-domain expansions. Each costs roughly 1–2 weeks of
focused work; doing all four of the "recommended next" cluster would
roughly double the perceived value of the app.

### Recommended next (top 4, in priority order)

- [~] **Step-by-step solutions** for `diff`, `integrate`, and `solve`.
  Show *why* an answer is what it is — the rule applied at each step
  (chain rule, product rule, u-substitution, partial fractions, …) —
  not just the final symbolic result. The single biggest perceived-
  value gap.
  - **Differentiation done** (HISTORY round 20): `lib/engine/step_engine.dart`
    walks the top-level expression shape and emits rule-named steps
    (constant, identity, sum/difference, product, quotient, power,
    exponential, chain rule for sin/cos/tan/asin/acos/atan/sinh/cosh/
    tanh/exp/ln/sqrt). Final answer comes from SymEngine so we don't
    drift from canonical. `StepsDialog` renders each step as a card
    with LaTeX-rendered formula + before/after. New `d/dx⌄` keypad
    button as the entry point.
  - **Equation solving done** (HISTORY round 21): same engine extended
    with `StepEngine.solve()`. Detects polynomial degree via SymEngine
    derivatives; linear (1-step isolation), quadratic (discriminant +
    formula), and a graceful fall-through to SymEngine's `solve()` for
    higher-order / transcendental cases. New `solve⌄` keypad button.
  - **Integration done (V1)** (HISTORY round 22): same engine extended
    with `StepEngine.integrate()`. Modeled on SymPy's
    `manualintegrate` — fixed rule list, each rule either emits a
    step and recurses on a simpler sub-integrand or declines.
    Coverage: constant, identity (∫x dx), power rule, logarithm rule
    (1/x and x^-1), sum/linearity, constant multiple, and standard
    antiderivatives for sin/cos/exp/sinh/cosh when the argument is
    just the variable. Substitution and integration by parts deferred
    to V2 — they need heuristic u-picking (LIATE) that V1 can't
    safely guess.
- [x] ~~**Interactive parameter sliders** on the graphing screen.~~
  Done 2026-05-17 — see HISTORY round 23. Identifiers in a function
  string that aren't the plot variable or a reserved name become
  parameters; a compact slider per parameter appears under each
  function chip, and the curve repaints live as the user drags.
  Values persist across restarts via shared_preferences.
- [ ] **Statistics + probability module**. Descriptive stats on a list
  of numbers, linear / polynomial / exponential regression, normal /
  binomial / t / chi-square distributions and quantiles, basic
  hypothesis tests. A whole school-curriculum use case we don't
  address at all today.
- [ ] **Unit-aware arithmetic**. `5 km / 30 min in mph`, `1 mile + 5 ft`,
  full SI prefix handling, dimension checking on results. Opens the
  engineering / physics / chemistry audience. Doable as a Dart
  preprocessor layer on top of the existing engine.

### Other meaningful gaps

#### Learning / pedagogy

- [ ] **Worked-example library**. Curated catalogue of problem types
  (related rates, optimization, vector projection, eigenvalue) with
  click-to-try examples. Discoverability + learning.
- [ ] **Plain-language step explanations**. After a step is shown
  symbolically, render a one-sentence EN/DE/FR/ES description of the
  rule applied. Builds directly on the step-by-step infrastructure.

#### Input

- [ ] **Photo OCR of handwritten or printed equations**. Camera-to-
  equation has become table stakes in the consumer math-help category.
  Possible on-device with TFLite or Apple's `VisionKit` (iOS); cloud
  OCR is faster to ship but conflicts with the on-device promise.
- [ ] **Pen / handwriting input**. Apple Pencil + macOS trackpad
  handwriting recognition (`PKCanvasView` + `MLHandwritingRecognizer`)
  for math expressions. Niche but high-end feature.

#### Math surface area

- [ ] **3D graphing**. Surface plots, parametric 3D curves,
  intersection with planes (we already have the plane math). Touch-
  rotate / pinch-zoom on the 3D canvas.
- [ ] **User-defined function namespace**. Today's graph slots
  Y1..Y10 are a partial story. Allow named functions
  (`f(x) = x^2 + 1`), composition (`g(f(x))`), and a tab to browse /
  edit / rename them.
- [ ] **Built-in constants library**. Physical (c, G, h, kB),
  mathematical (φ, Catalan, ζ(2), …), chemical (Avogadro), with one-
  tap insert into the calculator.

#### Engagement / sharing

- [ ] **Shareable state links**. URL-encode the full calculator state
  (graphed functions, viewport, stored variables) so a link drops a
  recipient onto the same view. Pairs naturally with the web build.
- [ ] **Web build**. Flutter Web + a WASM backend for the bridge
  plugin would widen reach roughly 10× (instant-try in any browser,
  embeddable in textbooks / docs sites). Significant porting work
  but plausible — the bridge would need a `web/` platform target
  that compiles SymEngine to WASM.

## Out of scope this round

- C++ implementation of symbolic `limit` and `integrate`.
- Rewriting the LaTeX↔engine parsing as a real grammar.
- Full accessibility audit.
